# Cyber-security
Cybersecurity is a vast and continuously evolving field, but here are a few key aspects that define this domain:

# Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA):

  One of the fundamental principles of cybersecurity is represented by CIA: confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Confidentiality ensures that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information. Integrity pertains to maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data, while availability ensures that information is accessible when needed.

# Cyber Attacks and Vulnerabilities:

  Cyber attacks can take various forms, ranging from malware and phishing to ransomware or "zero-day" attacks. Simultaneously, vulnerabilities in software and networks can be exploited by attackers. A critical aspect of cybersecurity involves identifying and addressing these vulnerabilities to prevent attacks.

#Risk Management and Adoption of Security Practices:

  Cybersecurity involves risk management. This entails not only preventing attacks but also planning to manage the potential consequences of a security incident. Adopting security practices, such as regularly updating software, implementing two-factor authentication, and educating users about cyber threats, plays an essential role in protecting a system or network.

  These are just a few introductory aspects in the field of cybersecurity, and expertise in this domain continually develops as technologies and threats evolve. It is crucial to have a holistic and proactive approach to managing cybersecurity to counteract current and future threats.
